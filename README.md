A simple restaurant page created with JavaScript, HTML and CSS bundled with webpack


My to do do list.

1. Reserve page should have only two numbers to call at the same Serenza Location as well as the address.


    - There should be 4 fields on the main form
        - A drop down menu allowing you to select the Serenza restaurant (Tokyo or Osaka)
        - A date selector that shows a calender when you click on it
        - The time you wish to arrive(Increments of 15mins)
        - The Number of people coming(Maximum of 20 per booking)

    - For large Group bookings(13+) then a call/email enquiry is needed. Another form on the right side of the page will be used.
